description: Ways to give support to the Ross Mathematics Program
---

Running the Ross Mathematics Program is expensive. The Ross Program is a nonprofit organization; most Ross funding currently arises from student fees, enhanced by gifts from generous donors and by income from the Program's Endowment Funds. Contributions to the Ross Program help us provide financial aid to participants, as well as to fund pay for counselors. By contributing to the Ross Program, you will help us make the Ross Program more accessible to participants, as well as for us to provide better quality instruction for students. 

We are grateful for any amount of contribution. With your support the Ross Program will continue to thrive!

### Corporate matching gifts

Many companies have giving plans that match their employees’ charitable contributions. 
Your employer’s Human Resources department can tell you whether such plans are in place.

### Alternative forms of support

We can work with you to accommodate contributions of various kinds, 
including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or publicly traded securities. 
Many donors prefer to contribute appreciated securities in order to 
take advantage of federal income tax deductions. A tax accountant or 
financial planner can provide advice on which options are best for you. 
Please contact us at [ross@rossprogram.org](mailto:ross@rossprogram.org) to discuss possibilities.

### Private and corporate donors

Do you know of a foundation or corporation that might support the educational mission 
of the Ross Program? If so, please contact us at [ross@rossprogram.org](mailto:ross@rossprogram.org) with suggestions.
