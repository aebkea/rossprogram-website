[Dr. Arnold Ross](alumni/biography) founded this multi-level program at Notre Dame University in 1957. Its growth was then spurred by the launch of the Sputnik satellite and the subsequent surge of interest in science education. Arnold Ross's Program has run every summer since then, associated mostly with Ohio State University from 1964 through 2018. In 2019, the Program moved to [Ohio Dominican University](https://ohiodominican.edu). In 2020 and 2021 the Ross Program was entirely online, but in-person sessions resumed in 2022 at Ohio Dominican University and [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology](https://rose-hulman.edu).

Professor Arnold E. Ross founded his math program for high school students in 1957, and he continued to run it every summer until 2000. Further information about his background and accomplishments is provided in a short [biography](alumni/biography) and a much longer [history](alumni/history).

From 2000 to 2018, the Ross Program was led by Daniel Shapiro. Now Jim Fowler has taken over as Director, but Shapiro is still active as Director-Emeritus.
