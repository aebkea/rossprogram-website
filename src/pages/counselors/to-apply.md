If you are interested in becoming a Ross Counselor, you may find the applications for 2023 [here](https://mathprograms.org/db?joblist-83) which became available on January 1, 2023. There are multiple sites to choose from and you may apply to one or more locations, i.e., you may apply to the Ohio location, or apply to the Indiana location, or apply to the tentatively planned location in the Philippines.

{% callout title="Notes" %}
1. Those applications who were counselors in a previous year are not required to submit another letter of recommendation.
2. The Ross Hiring Committee reads counselor applications during February. They expect to make some initial job offers in early March. To be considered in that first round, please submit your application by the end of February.
