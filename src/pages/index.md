The Ross Program is a 6-week intensive summer experience designed to encourage motivated pre-college students to explore mathematics. During those weeks, students are immersed in a world of mathematical discovery.

At the Ross Program, we provide students with a focused and supportive environment for mathematical exploration. Mathematical thinking is valuable not only for careers in mathematics research, science, and finance, but also for critical thinking and informed citizenship. At Ross, we hope to help nurture mathematical curiosity and logical thinking in our students to produce future leaders in the world.
