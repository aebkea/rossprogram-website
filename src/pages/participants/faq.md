## General Questions

### Is admission automatic?

The admission process is competitive. In 2023, about 15% of the applicants with complete applications were accepted. Each successful applicant has a strong high school record and exhibits excellent work on the mathematical problems that form part of the application.

### Are scholarships available?

The Ross Program is able to provide scholarship support to qualified students who cannot otherwise afford to attend. Requests for support are made after a student has been accepted to the Program.
Various academic institutions in the applicant’s home city or state might also have available scholarships. In addition, some scholarship support for participation in math programs is provided by [Mu Alpha Theta](https://mualphatheta.org/summer-grants), the national high school mathematical society. Other scholarship opportunities are offered by the [Davidson Institute](https://davidsongifted.org) and the [Jack Kent Cooke Foundation](https://jkcf.org).

## Packing List Questions

### What do students need to bring?

Sheets and a pillowcase are provided. Students need to bring or purchase their own towels and pillows, as well as shampoo, soap, etc. Students should also bring clothes appropriate for a warm Columbus summer, in air-conditioned buildings. It’s a good idea to bring a jacket and rain gear. A certain amount of cash is needed for items like snacks and souvenirs.

### How do most students handle money – cash, credit cards, ATMs? {% shortheading="How do most students handle money?" %}

Nearby stores accept all major American credit cards. Students may use ATMs to withdraw cash from home accounts. If there is a problem, one of the staff members can take students to a bank to help them get a cash advance, cash personal checks, etc.

### What expenses are not covered in the program fees? Do you have a suggested/recommended additional spending allowance?

Off-campus trips will be organized by Ross staff members. Students participating in those excursions may be asked to pay a small fee. Washers and dryers in the dorm are provided without additional charge but detergent is purchased separately. There is not much more that students are expected to buy. Some students purchase books, extra food, souvenirs, etc.

### Is there shopping within easy access?

There are stores nearby, but students should not leave the campus unless accompanied by a counselor. If special items are needed, a counselor will arrange to transport students to a store.

### Are laptop computers allowed? What about other electronic devices? {% shortheading="Are electronic devices allowed?" %}

Mathematical ideas presented in the Ross Program are investigated with pencil and paper. We ask students to refrain from using their phones. Students are NOT allowed to bring electronic tablets, TV sets, video game systems, DVD players, etc.

## Transportation Questions

### What is the transportation around campus? e.g. to/from lectures and the dorm? {% shortheading="What is the transportation around campus?" %}

All travel on campus is by walking.

### Where are the math lectures and seminars held?

Lectures and seminars will be held in campus buildings within a few blocks of the dormitory.

### Is there transportation to/from the airport if an attendee flies in or out unaccompanied? {% shortheading="Is there transportation to/from the airport?" %}

Students who fly to attend the program at Ross/Ohio will arrive at the John Glenn Columbus International Airport (CMH). Students who fly to attend the program at Ross/Indiana will arrive at the Indianopolis International Airport (IND). Ross staff members will meet arriving students in the terminal, and make arrangements to transport them to the dormitory. At the end of the summer session, Program staff will arrange for transportation back to the airport.

### Do some students bring cars? Are there restrictions on students riding with other students? {% shortheading="Do some students bring cars?" %}

First-year students are not allowed to bring cars.

### Do students bring/use bicycles?

Students are not allowed to bring bicycles, scooters, skateboards, or similar items.

## Health Concerns

### Is a physical required?

No. But we need to know of any existing medical conditions and current medications, so a health history is required.

### Do we need health insurance?

Yes. Each student must have medical insurance with coverage in Ohio or Indiana. Proof of insurance is required. If you do not have adequate coverage, we can suggest places to purchase short-term health insurance.

### Is there a nurse on duty and doctors on call? Is there a campus clinic that they can attend for minor problems?

The campus does not offer a medical clinic, but University staff members with training in first-aid are available 24 hours per day. If a student is sick or injured, a counselor or staff member will transport and accompany them to a nearby hospital or clinic.

### Is there a pharmacy on campus?

There are pharmacies a mile or so away from campus. Ross staff members will organize a shopping mall trip for those students who need to purchase items at a pharmacy.

## International Concerns

### Do you accept international students?

Every year, several students from outside the U.S. are accepted to the
Ross Program. They are highly talented, eager to learn abstract
mathematical ideas, and fluent in English. Some financial aid is
available for excellent students, but we can rarely provide support
for travel expenses.

### What sort of visa is needed?

Students at the Ross Mathematics Program are not registered as college
students, and do not receive official credit from the University. 
Therefore this Program is classified as a 'mathematical vacation' 
so you may use a tourist visa (B-2).

However, there are serious concerns about travel restrictions and quarantines
imposed to combat the pandemic. Those rules might prevent some students from attending the Program.  
We hope that many of those restrictions will be lifted by June.  

## Just Curious

### How many students are admitted to the Program?

We expect about 60 first-year students at each site, supported by 15 
junior counselors and 15 counselors.

### What is the ratio of boys to girls?

In past years, about one-fourth of the participants have been female.

### What is the average age? What is the age spread? Is my child too young/old?

Nearly all first-year students are 15 to 18 years old, and the average
age is usually 16 or 17. In rare cases we admit some exceptionally
mature 14 year olds, as well as some students who have already
graduated from high school.

### Where do the students come from?

Ross participants come from all over the United States, and from several other countries.
In addition to students from China, South Korea, and India, we have hosted
students from other countries, including Botswana, Canada, Chile, France,
Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kyrgyzstan, Mexico, Russia,
Serbia, Singapore, Spain, Taiwan, and Turkey. 

### How does the Ross Program compare to other summer math programs like PROMYS, Canada/USA Mathcamp, HCSSiM, SUMaC, HSMC, etc? {% shortheading="How does the Ross Program compare to other summer math programs?" %}

Prominent summer math programs for high school students are listed on various sites
A key feature of the Ross Program is that the students concentrate deeply on just one
subject for the entire session. We are convinced that this level of
focus and depth is far more valuable than short overviews of many
different topics.

PROMYS at Boston University is the summer program most similar to the
Ross Program.
