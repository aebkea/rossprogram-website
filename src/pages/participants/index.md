## What is the Ross Mathematics Program?

Ross is a six-week, residential, summer session for high school students who are talented in mathematics, well prepared in standard high school math topics, and eager to explore more advanced ideas. In 2020 and 2021 the Ross Program was entirely online. In 2022, we returned to in-person sessions, with participants living in a dormitory.

Ross participants spend most of each day working on challenging sets of problems dealing with abstract mathematical concepts. By working for several weeks on one subject (number theory), participants delve deeply into the underpinnings of that subject, but more importantly, they learn to communicate mathematical ideas clearly and to write convincing proofs of all their assertions. One goal of this program is to provide a first step toward independent mathematical research. It is not oriented toward math contests, and direct competition between students is discouraged.

## Program Dates

There will be two sites for the Ross/USA program:

- at Otterbein University in Columbus, OH, June 11 through July 21, 2023, and
- at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, Indiana, June 18 through July 28, 2023.

{% callout type="warning" title="Late arrival" %}
The Ross Program cannot accommodate students who must arrive more than two days after the start of classes.

All participants will live in a dormitory on campus. Typically, students live with three roommates in a small suite of rooms. Learn more about [living arrangements at the Ross Program.](/participants/life-at-ross)

## Eligibility and Applying

Ambitious pre-college students with interests in mathematics and science are invited to apply. First-year students range in age from 15 to 18 years old, but in rare cases, younger or older students are accepted. Admission decisions are based on several criteria, including: school, transcripts, teacher recommendations, essays concerning the applicant's interests and goals, and the applicant's work on some challenging math problems.

The fee for attending the Ross Program is $7000, though we are able to provide financial aid for students who need financial assistance to attend the program. The student fee covers tuition, housing, and meals at the Ross Program. Learn more about [applying to the Ross Program and financial aid.](participants/to-apply)

## Nondiscrimination Policy

The Ross Mathematics Program admits students of any race, color, national origin, and ethnic origin to all the rights, privileges, programs, and activities generally accorded or made available to students at the Ross Program. It doesn't discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, or ethnic origin in administration of its educational policies, admission policies, scholarship and loan programs, and athletic and other Ross-administered programs.

We recognize the existing gender and racial disparities within the mathematics community. In our commitment to fostering a diverse and inclusive environment, we highly encourage applications from individuals of underrepresented backgrounds.
