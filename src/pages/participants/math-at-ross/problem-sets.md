By investigating a sequence of related problems over several days, participants observe patterns, make conjectures, explore further examples to test the conjectures, formulate theorems, write up proofs, polish the arguments, and investigate generalizations.

participants proceed at various paces through the problem sets. In fact, few participants are able to master all the ideas and techniques the first time they see them. The Ross counselors strive to build a "community of scholars" in the dormitory, encouraging everyone to work on these challenging mathematical ideas, to share their ideas and insights, and to experience the joy of solving a difficult problem.

In solving a problem, participants are asked to write clear and accurate proofs of all their assertions. This practice with logical thinking and experience in mathematical writing will be of great use in abstract mathematics and science courses taken in college.

Participants submit their work on the problem sets to their counselor, who will provide constructive feedback and assign revisions if necessary. We value revisions to encourage participants to think more deeply about their work and mathematics, and ensure a solid understanding of the material. There is no numerical grading.

To provide an idea of the level of mathematics involved, [here is a copy]() of one of the Ross Program problem sets.
