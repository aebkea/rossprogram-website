## Application Deadline

The deadline for Ross applications is March 31. Applications submitted after that date might not receive full consideration. The Ross Admissions Committe will start reading applications on April 1. Acceptance decisions will be emailed later that month.

## Costs and Financial Aid

Each Ross student is asked to pay a program fee of $6000. Those funds are used to pay for six weeks of room and board, to hire instructors and counselors, and to cover incidental costs of developing and running math courses.
