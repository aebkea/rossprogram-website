## A Day at the Ross Program

A typical weekday at the Ross Program consists of a morning number theory lecture, followed by small-group discussions typically relating to the number theory lecture. The rest of the day is typically more self-structured by students. Students typically spend most of their time working on the Ross problem sets, which form the core of the program, or attending various optional lectures organized by counselors and professors.

## Living Arrangements

### How are the dorm rooms at Ross/USA furnished?

The dormitories and classroom buildings are air-conditioned. Each participant is provided
- a single bed,
- a desk,
- a chair,
- closet space,
- and bedsheets.

Furnishings and other provisions may vary between campuses. If admitted, please pay attention to camp communications for any updates.

### Is there a curfew?

All students must remain inside the dormitory after dark or other appointed time and must not leave the campus at any time unless accompanied by a counselor.

### Are the students segregated from college students and from other summer camps?

The Ross Mathematics Program usually fills up several floors of the dormitory. Other summer camps may be held on campus. Their participants arrive and leave throughout the sumer and some of them might occupy the same dormitory building.

### What are the security arrangements in the dorm?

The dormitory is locked, accessible only by key card. Each suite has its own lock and key. In spite of these arrangements there is always some potential for theft or other crime, so we advise students not to bring valuable items or large amounts of cash.

### Will the Ross counselors check that students eat good food, do laundry, clean their room, etc.?

Ross counselors and students live in the same dormitory. Counselors certainly provide supervision, but students must be mature enough to choose what they eat and when they eat, do their own laundry, keep themselves and their rooms clean, and get enough sleep. If a participant is not mature enough to do these things, or distracts other students from their mathematical work, we will have to arrange for that student to leave the program and return home.

### What do they eat? Where do they eat? How often do they eat? Are there any accommodations for special dietary needs?

Student fees include the cost of three meals per day at the campus cafeteria. Upon request, the cafeteria can provide foods for students who are on restrictive diets. Some foods (e.g. pizza) can be ordered from nearby restaurants and delivered to the dorm.

## Recreation

### Is social interaction encouraged? Are there events planned for nights and weekends?

Social interaction and collaboration are encouraged! Mathematics is a social activity, and the Ross Program seeks to foster a supportive environment for students to share in the joy of mathematics together.

The Ross Program is a very unique opportunity to learn about and engross oneself completely in mathematics in a collaborative setting. We hope that participants at the Ross Program dedicate their energy towards enjoying and sharing mathematics, so we ask students to delay the gratification of watching a new movie, their favorite show, or playing their favorite games until after the program concludes.

We at the Ross Program view math as an exciting and fun, though challenging, activity, and so we hope participants will feel the same, spending most of their waking hours, including on weekends, working on mathematics. Counselors may however organize some informal activities like Ultimate Frisbee games and a talent show.

### Will participants have access to campus recreational/gym facilities?

Our insurance and the hosting campus limit the facilities that participants can use, so generally participants should not expect to be able to use the gyms and other indoor facilities.

Students are welcome to use the outdoor facilities that are made available to the program, and are encouraged to use these resources to maintain their own physical well-being. The program may be able to supply basketballs, soccerballs, etc., for these purposes.

### Do you conduct field trips to other locations?

Yes, counselors may plan some off-campus trips. Students might be asked to pay a small fee in order to join the organized trips.

### Are parents allowed to make mid-session visits to campus? What is the process?

We strongly discourage overnight absences for Ross students. Students build up momentum working full-time on hard problems, and that momentum is halted when a student is separated from the program for a day or two. Parents are certainly welcome to visit for a day and take students out to dinner, but extended absences tend to distract students from their mathematical motivations and interest. For security reasons, parents are not allowed to enter the dorms.

In order for a participant to leave campus with their parent or guardian, the parent or guardian must request and fill out an absence form, detailing the duration of the absence and declaring exactly who is taking charge of the participant.
