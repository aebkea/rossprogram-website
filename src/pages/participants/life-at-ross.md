## A Day at the Ross Program

A typical weekday at the Ross Program consists of a morning number theory lecture, followed by small-group discussions typically relating to the number theory lecture. The rest of the day is typically more self-structured by students. Students typically spend most of their time working on the Ross Problem Sets, which form the core of the program, or attending various optional lectures organized by counselors and professors.

## Living Arrangements

### How are the dorm rooms at Ross/USA furnished?

The dormitories and classroom buildings are air-conditioned. Each participant uses a single bed, a desk, a chair, and some closet space, and is provided two sheets, a pillowcase, and a blanket. Students provide their own towels and washcloths, pillows, clothes hangers, shampoo, soap, and other personal items. Since towels and pillows are bulky to transport, staff members will take students to stores where those items can be purchased at fairly low costs.

### Is there a curfew?

All students must remain inside the dormitory after dark and must not leave the campus at any time unless accompanied by a counselor.

### Are the students segregated from college students and from other summer camps?

The Ross Mathematics Program usually fills up several floors of the dormitory. Other summer camps may be held on campus. Their participants arrive and leave throughout the sumer and some of them might occupy the same dormitory building.

### What are the security arrangements in the dorm?

The dormitory is locked, accessible only by key card. Each suite has its own lock and key. In spite of these arrangements there is always some potential for theft or other crime, so we advise students not to bring valuable items or large amounts of cash.

### Will the Ross counselors check that students eat good food, do laundry, clean their room, etc.?

Ross counselors and students live in the same dormitory. Counselors certainly provide supervision, but students must be mature enough to choose what they eat and when they eat, do their own laundry, keep themselves and their rooms clean, and get enough sleep. If someone is not mature enough to do these things, or distracts other students from their mathematical work, we will arrange for that student to leave the program and return home.

### What do they eat? Where do they eat? How often do they eat? Are there any accommodations for special dietary needs?

Student fees include the cost of three meals per day at the campus cafeteria. Upon request, the cafeteria can provide foods for students who are on restrictive diets. Some foods (e.g. pizza) can be ordered from nearby restaurants and delivered to the dorm.

## Recreation

### Are there events planned for nights and weekends? Is social interaction encouraged?

Counselors organize some informal activities like Ultimate Frisbee games and a talent show. However, students are expected to spend most of their waking hours working on the mathematical problem sets, including on weekends.

Social interaction and collaboration are encouraged! Mathematics is a social activity, and the Ross Program seeks to foster a supportive environment for students to share in the joy of mathematics together.

### Do you conduct field trips to other locations?

Yes, we are planning some off-campus trips. Students might be asked to pay a small fee in order to join the organized trips.

### Are parents allowed or encouraged to make mid-session visits to campus?

We strongly discourage overnight absences for Ross students. Students build up momentum working full-time on hard problems, and that momentum is halted when a student takes a day or two off. Parents are certainly welcome to visit for a day and take students out to dinner, but movies or similar events tend to distract students from mathematical motivations and interests. They can watch movies and TV at home after the Ross Program is over. This policy might seem stringent, but the point is to get students excited about mathematical ideas and to concentrate all of their energy on solving interesting math problems.
