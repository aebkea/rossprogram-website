Participants in this six-week summer course attend class for ten hours per week (five in lecture and five in small-group meetings). Apart from those classes, students structure their own time, with the understanding that they will spend many hours concentrating on the challenging mathematical ideas presented in class and on the problem sets.

The first-year course in the Ross Program is organized around a series of problem sets in number theory. These sets invite the participants to contemplate a variety of seemingly simple questions about numbers and their relationships. As the summer progresses, the students are encouraged to investigate these questions in increasing depth, and to return to them periodically as their skill at abstract reasoning and their collection of available tools become more powerful.

This spiraling of concepts is summarized in the Ross Program's motto: "Think deeply about simple things."

To realize this idea, we concentrate on one central subject, rather than touching lightly on many disjoint mathematical topics. Ross students spend the entire summer focusing their attention on integers and their properties. Students should expect to get deeply involved in intensive mathematical work. Although formal classes take up only eight hours per week, Ross participants work hard during the many hours of unstructed time. After solving a problem, students are asked to write clear and accurate proofs of all their assertions. This practice with logical thinking and experience in mathematical writing will be of great use in abstract science and mathematics courses taken in college.

Number Theory was chosen as the central topic for the Ross Program because many of its ideas are close to the surface and easily noticed, but deeper concepts and connections are available for exploration. Ross participants investigate this one subject deeply and at length. Although students might not encounter these topics in standard high school or college courses, there is tremendous value in the experience of delving deeply into one subject.

The topics mentioned below appear throughout the problem sets, with different topic-threads often appearing on the same set. By investigating a sequence of related problems over several days, students observe patterns, make conjectures, explore further examples to test the conjectures, formulate theorems, write up proofs, polish the arguments, and investigate generalizations.

Students proceed at various paces through the problem sets. In fact, few students are able to master all the ideas and techniques the first time they see them. The Ross counselors strive to build a "community of scholars" in the dormitory, encouraging everyone to work on these challenging mathematical ideas, to share their ideas and insights, and to experience the joy of solving a difficult problem.
