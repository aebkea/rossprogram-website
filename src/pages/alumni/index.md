Alumni are a central and important part of the Ross community.

## Our [60th Anniversary Celebration](alumni/reunions/2017) was held in June 2017.

A Reunion-Conference was held in Columbus on June 16â€“18, 2017. Alumni and friends joined together to renew ties, reminisce, and meet current Ross participants. Previous Ross Reunion-Conferences were held in [1996](alumni/reunions/1996), [2001](alumni/reunions/2001), and [2007](alumni/reunions/2007).

If you were once a Ross Program participant, we would love to hear from you at [ross@rossprogram.org](mailto:ross@rossprogram.org).

- Did the Ross Program have some influence on your life or career?
- What have you been doing since your summer(s) here?

See our [News and Comments](alumni/news) pages for a few alumni messages. You are also welcome to contribute a [Ross anecdote](alumni/stories), and to visit the [Arnold Ross Facebook page](https://facebook.com/RossMathematicsProgram/).

Of course, our Program needs [financial support](alumni/contribute) to pay for scholarships and other expenses.
